# TrustLens LK — Threat Model

**Author:** Member 4 (Safe Scanner & Security Controls)
**Last updated:** 2026-09-20
**Status:** Complete

## 1. Scope

This document covers the attack surface of the TrustLens LK backend API (`services/api`) and the planned isolated URL scanner (`services/scanner`). The frontend (`apps/web`) is treated as an untrusted client; no secrets or privileged logic reside there.

---

## 2. System Overview

```
[User Browser]
      │  HTTPS
      ▼
[API — services/api]   ─── Supabase REST API (postgres + storage)
      │
      │  HTTP (internal only, planned)
      ▼
[Scanner — services/scanner]   ─── Chromium / Playwright (isolated)
```

The API is a stateless Node.js HTTP server. It accepts text or URL submissions, runs deterministic rules and domain lookups, optionally calls the scanner, and returns a verdict. The scanner is a planned separate service that fetches URLs in a sandboxed Chromium instance.

---

## 3. Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Direction | Trust Level |
|---|---|---|
| User browser → API | Inbound | **Untrusted** — all input validated and bounded |
| API → Supabase | Outbound | Trusted channel — service-role key never exposed to client |
| API → Scanner | Outbound (internal) | Semi-trusted — scanner only reachable from API, not public internet |
| Scanner → External URLs | Outbound | **Untrusted** — sandboxed Chromium, SSRF-protected |

---

## 4. Identified Threats and Mitigations

### 4.1 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Threat:** A user submits a URL pointing to an internal resource (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`) and the scanner fetches it, leaking cloud metadata or hitting internal services.

**Current Mitigations (implemented):**
- `validateScannerUrl()` in [`urlSafety.mjs`](../services/api/src/services/urlSafety.mjs) blocks all of:
  - `localhost` and `.localhost`
  - IPv4 private ranges: `10.x`, `172.16-31.x`, `192.168.x`, `169.254.x` (link-local), `0.x`, `100.64-127.x` (CGNAT), `198.18-19.x`, `224-239.x` (multicast)
  - IPv6 private: `::1`, `::`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`
  - IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`::ffff:` prefix) pointing to private ranges
  - Only `http:` and `https:` protocols allowed — blocks `file:`, `ftp:`, `javascript:` etc.

**Remaining Gap:**
- DNS rebinding: A hostname like `public.attacker.com` resolves to a public IP at validation time but rebinds to `192.168.1.1` at fetch time. The API cannot protect against this alone.

**Scanner Mitigation (Implemented):**
- The scanner service uses Playwright's network interception (`route.fetch`) to perform a new DNS resolution for the actual IP of each request (including redirects).
- It blocks private addresses before any connection is made on every hop.
- Redirects are intercepted and followed securely by explicitly calling `page.goto` on the resolved destination, ensuring no bypass via native Chromium redirect handling.

---

### 4.2 DNS Rebinding

**Threat:** A DNS record for a public-looking hostname has a short TTL and flips to a private IP between the API's hostname check and the scanner's actual fetch. This bypasses the syntactic SSRF check.

**Current Mitigations:**
- The API syntactic check handles initial validation.
- The scanner service actively mitigates DNS rebinding during the fetch phase.

**Scanner Mitigation (Implemented):**
- The scanner service uses Playwright's network interception to resolve the actual IP of each request (including every hop of a redirect chain) before connecting and applies the same private-range blocklist.
- DNS resolution uses an internal Map cache for the lifetime of the scan (a few seconds max), minimizing any rebinding windows during the scan itself.

---

### 4.3 Prompt Injection / Rule Bypass

**Threat:** A user crafts a message that uses Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, or unusual whitespace to bypass keyword rules (e.g., `0TP` instead of `OTP`).

**Current Mitigations:**
- Rules use case-insensitive regex (`/i` flag).
- Some Unicode Sinhala terms are matched directly.

**Remaining Gap:**
- No normalization of Unicode lookalike characters or zero-width joiners before matching.
- No AI/LLM layer to catch semantic evasion.

**Planned Mitigation:**
- AI context analysis (Gemini) is planned as an additional layer for semantic detection without replacing deterministic rules.

---

### 4.4 Malicious File Downloads via Scanner

**Threat:** A URL the scanner visits triggers an automatic download of a malicious file (e.g., a `.exe` or `.apk`). This file lands on the scanner host.

**Scanner Mitigations (Implemented):**
- Network interception blocks file downloads via `page.route()`.
- The scanner sets a strict `MAX_PAGE_BYTES` limit (default 5MB) on responses to prevent resource exhaustion via large files.
- The scanner enforces a strict `SCAN_TIMEOUT` (default 10s) to prevent hanging on slow malicious streams.
- The Playwright Chromium instance is isolated and destroys context after each scan.

---

### 4.5 Credential Leakage via Supabase Key

**Threat:** The Supabase service-role key is a secret that grants full database access. If it is exposed in source code, logs, or Postman collections, the database is fully compromised.

**Current Mitigations:**
- `services/api/.env` is in `.gitignore`.
- The env file was actively removed from Git tracking during setup.
- The key is never returned in API responses.
- The key is used server-side only via `fetch` to Supabase's REST API.

**Remaining Action:**
- Rotate the Supabase service-role key before any production or competition deployment.
- Confirm `.env` never appeared in any commit in the repository history.

---

### 4.6 Request Size and Denial of Service

**Threat:** A large request body or extremely long text exhausts memory or CPU in the API process.

**Current Mitigations:**
- `MAX_BODY_BYTES = 15,000` enforced via `Content-Length` header check and streaming byte counter.
- `MAX_TEXT = 10,000` characters checked after parsing.
- In-memory rate limiter: 60 requests per IP per minute (configurable).
- `429 RATE_LIMITED` response with `Retry-After` header.
- In-memory rate store capped at 1,000 IP entries.

**Remaining Gap:**
- Rate limiting is in-memory and resets on restart. A distributed deployment would need Redis or similar.
- No per-IP blocking for sustained abuse.

---

### 4.7 Information Disclosure via Error Messages

**Threat:** Detailed error messages leak internal stack traces or file paths to the client.

**Current Mitigations:**
- API returns structured error codes (`INVALID_JSON`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `PERSISTENCE_ERROR`) without stack traces.
- No internal paths or service names are exposed in responses.
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` prevents MIME-type sniffing attacks.
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` prevents clickjacking.
- `Cache-Control: no-store` prevents sensitive response caching.
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` prevents leaking the submission URL to third parties.

---

### 4.8 Cross-Origin Requests

**Threat:** A malicious website makes cross-origin requests to the API, piggy-backing on an authenticated user session.

**Current Mitigations:**
- CORS origin is restricted to a single configured origin (`CORS_ORIGIN` env var, defaults to `http://localhost:5173`).
- Only `POST` and `GET` methods are allowed via CORS.
- Allowed headers are explicitly listed.

---

### 4.9 Scanner Container Escape

**Threat (future):** A malicious webpage exploits a Chromium vulnerability to escape the browser sandbox and execute code on the scanner host.

**Planned Mitigations:**
- Chromium runs with `--no-sandbox` disabled — the full sandbox is enabled.
- Scanner runs as a non-root user inside a Docker container with a read-only root filesystem (planned).
- No persistent state in the scanner container — destroyed after each scan.
- Scanner container has no access to the host network beyond what is needed to fetch the target URL.
- The scanner is not reachable from the public internet — only from the API.
