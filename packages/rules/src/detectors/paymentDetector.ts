/**
 * ADVANCE PAYMENT DETECTOR
 *
 * Detects language that demands an upfront monetary payment before delivering
 * any promised service or employment — the defining characteristic of fee-fraud
 * and job-scam schemes prevalent in Sri Lanka.
 *
 * This is a CRITICAL signal: its presence alone is sufficient to trigger
 * the STOP_AND_AVOID critical override in the main rules engine.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   "Pay Rs. 2,500 registration fee to activate your account."
 *   "Send a refundable deposit of LKR 5,000 to secure your slot."
 *   "Processing fee Rs.1,000 required before your interview."
 *   "Transfer money to account 123456 at People's Bank."
